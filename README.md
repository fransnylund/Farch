# Frans's Arch Linux Installer (Farch)

## About Farch
---
Farch is an Arch Linux installation and post-installation script. It does the installation but can also install things in post-installation. Farch is split into three scripts. The user only has to launch the main one, Farch, which will later run the two other scripts. The installer also comes with two text files. These are package lists that allow the script to download the programs specified in the lists. These lists are my personal programs that I use, feel free to replace them with your own programs if you desire. It's worth nothing that this installer is still in beta. There will be bugs. Farch is also only confirmed to work in Virtualbox(I have not tested it on hardware yet).


## How to Install and Use
---
Make sure you're in a freshly booted up Arch install screen and run the following commands:

`git clone https://github.com/fransnylund/Farch.git`

`cd Farch`

`bash Farch`

This is all you have to do depending on what you select in the installer.
